# `host`: deploying to the machine at home

`apps/deploy/host` is a small deployment platform for the always-on machine on the home network -- the one
milestones D1 and D2 in web's `spec/todo/milestones.md` assume. An app in this
repository or in the platform's declares that it runs there, and a push to that repository's `main`
then reaches it without anybody logging into the machine. An image somebody else publishes comes in
the same way, by a directory of its own -- see "An upstream image is adopted, not rebuilt".

The machine has no inbound public address. It reaches out through a Cloudflare tunnel, and it is on
the tailnet. Everything below is shaped by that and by there being exactly one user. Which services
are placed on it, and how names and APIs reach them, is platform's `spec/architecture/services.md`.

## One name inside, and a domain label outside

An app has one name, and every place inside the node it appears is that name: `panel` is the app in
host, the container, `/data/apps/panel/` on the machine, its network and its logs. **What it is
reached by from outside is a DNS label of its own**, `[interface] domain` in its `service.toml`,
which is the name unless it says otherwise: the panel is `infra.internal.ixc.one` and `infra.canmi.app`.
A service's name is what code and people use; the label is what the address says, and it can
change without the service being renamed.

- A name and a label are DNS labels: lowercase letters, digits and hyphens.
- Apps from every repository a node deploys from, and images from elsewhere, share the one
  namespace of names, and apps
  and routes share the one namespace of labels: no two things answer on one label.
- `host` and `keeper` are reserved names for the two programs below, `meter` for what samples the
  machine ([meter.md](meter.md)), `api` for the API host, `caddy` for the door host deploys and
  `tunnel` for the way in from Cloudflare (both below), `panel` for host's interface, `resolver`
  for the house's DNS, and `cloudflared` because the tunnel ran under that name before host
  deployed it. `gateway` is not among them: the platform's gateway is deployed here as an app.
- **Labels are reserved too, for what is on its way**: `cms`, for the editor, which keeps its own
  address until it moves. No app or route may take a reserved label.
- **The private suffix is a mirror of part of `.app`, and nothing else.** Every label is on `.app`, reached
  from the public side behind Access and from the LAN alike; `internal.ixc.one` carries a label only as a copy
  of what `.app` answers on it, same paths, same service, for reaching it on the LAN without
  Access. A label may be left off `internal.ixc.one` -- `lan = false` on an interface, `private = false` on a route -- and nothing
  is ever on `internal.ixc.one` alone. So keeper's whole interface is on `keeper.canmi.app` behind Access as
  well, and the API host answers every scope on both, the private ones included: the public never
  reaches a private scope, since Access stands in front of `api.canmi.app` and the gateway passes
  on only the scopes in its table, and our Workers reach every scope through the one VPC service.

**A label is declared in the repository, and the panel will write it there.** The rule for every
setting a declaration holds: git is the one record, and a change made in the panel becomes a
pull request against the repository the app's declaration lives in, which a bot opens, deployed like any other change once it is
merged. Until then the panel shows it as pending. The bot is a GitHub account of its own, a
collaborator given access to the repository like a person, so what it proposes is reviewed like
anyone's and its token opens pull requests and nothing more. It is not built yet; until it is, a
label is changed in `service.toml`.

`internal.ixc.one` is private and `.app` is public, and what each admits is
platform's `spec/architecture/services.md`, "A domain says who can reach it, not what is behind it".

## One version runs, and a failed deploy puts the last one back

**Each app runs exactly one container.** A deploy stops it, snapshots its directory, starts the new
image and checks it. If the check fails, the directory is put back from the snapshot and the
previous image is started again. A deploy costs a few seconds of the app being down, which one user
accepts; what it buys is that two versions never write the same data at once.

**Rejected: Vercel's model of immutable deployments behind a moving alias.** It runs old and new side
by side, which is what makes its rollback instant and its releases gapless. Both are worth something
to many users sharing a service. Here they cost two copies of every app, and two processes over one
SQLite file, to save a pause nobody else sees.

The snapshot is taken after the container stops, so it is never of a database halfway through a
write. `/data` is btrfs and **each app's directory is its own subvolume**, so the snapshot is atomic,
covers exactly that app, and costs nothing until something is written. The directory is therefore
created with `btrfs subvolume create`, never `mkdir`: a plain directory cannot be snapshotted alone.

**Two rollbacks, and only one restores data.** A deploy that fails its check restores the snapshot,
since the new version may already have changed the data. Going back to an older version days later
starts the older image on the current data, since restoring would erase everything written since. The
second is a choice offered, never a default.

host keeps the previous image of every app and the last few snapshots, and removes the rest. Nothing
else on the machine needs tending.

## The machine pulls; nothing pushes into it

**Rejected: CI building, then SSH-ing in to run `docker compose`.** Two reasons, each sufficient. The
credential CI would hold is root on the machine and a way onto the tailnet, so any compromise of CI --
a poisoned dependency, a hostile action, a leaked secret -- is a compromise of the house. And a
compose file can ask for anything: `privileged`, the host's root as a volume, the Docker socket. A
channel that accepts one has no boundary to enforce.

So the direction is reversed, and trust is moved off the channel.

- CI builds only the apps a push changed -- `.mise/tasks/deployable` reads the change against the
  crate graph -- for `linux/arm64`, each as its image archive beside its `service.toml`, and uploads
  them as artifacts of that workflow run. **Nothing is published**: no release, no package, no
  registry. This is one repository holding many apps, and a publishing ritual per app is exactly the
  cost that stops small apps being written. The build is `.mise/tasks/image`, the same one a local
  deploy runs, and CI checks the workspace out around this repository so the compiler is the one
  its `rust-toolchain.toml` names.
- When the run ends, **GitHub's webhook**, set on `monoflake/infra` and `monoflake/platform` alike,
  tells the platform's hook on `api.monoflake.com`, which checks the delivery's signature and passes
  the run's number and its repository to the node's host, and to keeper -- see platform's
  `spec/architecture/services.md`, "Every node is the same node".
  There is no polling and no step in the workflow for it; the event says exactly which run ended,
  and that it succeeded.
- host asks GitHub about that run with `GITHUB_ACTIONS_TOKEN`, a fine-grained token owned by the
  monoflake organization with Actions read on its sources, and **runs nothing unless the answer is
  one of its sources' `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`, on `main`, finished and successful** -- the
  one path `libs/deploy`'s `WORKFLOW` accepts; then downloads the artifact and checks it against the digest GitHub recorded. The
  notice is a hint, not an authority: a forged one can at worst redeploy what `main` already built.
- **A node's sources are its own to name**, in `DEPLOY_SOURCES` in the node's `.env`, as
  `owner/name` pairs: a run is numbered within its repository, so a notice names the repository
  with the run, and one that names a repository the node does not list is refused before GitHub is
  asked. Without the list a node deploys nothing rather than guessing; today it is
  `monoflake/infra monoflake/platform`. The hook keeps a list of its own, `DEPLOY_SOURCES` exported
  by the platform's `@monoflake/sdk`, the same two, to pass on only what some node might take; the
  node's decides. A repository outside the organization, such as `canmi21/web`, cannot be a source
  without a second token. A notice that names no repository, from before they did, means the
  node's source only on a node with one; a node with two refuses it.

**Rejected: verifying a Sigstore attestation of each archive.** An attestation proves an artifact came
from a given repository's workflow on a given ref, which is what matters when the artifact is taken
from somewhere else -- a registry, a mirror. Here it is taken from GitHub's API, for a named run whose
repository, workflow, branch, event and outcome that same API states, over the same TLS. Both prove
the same thing, and the attestation's half is a certificate chain, a transparency log and a trust
root to verify in Rust, the most intricate code on the path for no guarantee the run record lacks.

An artifact expires after its retention period. That does not matter to a deploy, since the image is
on the machine once loaded, and a rollback uses the image host kept.

A local deploy is `wrangler deploy`'s shape: built on the Mac, which is arm64 like the machine, into
the same archive, and uploaded by a mise task to an interface that answers only on the LAN and the
tailnet. What admits it is the token below, not an attestation. So there is one artifact format with
two sources, and no registry anywhere.

## What a deployment may ask for is host's decision

An app declares what it needs; host turns that into a container and decides which capabilities exist
at all. A network of its own shared with Caddy alone, the app's own directory and nothing else, no
`privileged`, no host network, no Docker socket, resource limits always. This translation is the
whole of what host adds over a compose file, and it is why a manifest declares rather than executes.

### A role is asked for by the app and granted by the node

**A service above infra that needs more than a sandbox asks for a role, and the node grants it.**
The roles are what host can make of a container beyond the sandbox: the scheduler, which is given
every job's table and each socket service's directory; the steward, which runs as root with the
machine's D-Bus socket; the reporter, which is given host's account of the services and the
meter's readings; the driver of a kind, whose image every sidecar of that kind runs; and a claim on
hostnames, which Caddy routes and the resolver answers. An app asks in its `service.toml` --
`[shape] kind = "scheduler"`, `[driver] provides = "objects"` -- and the node's `.env` grants, in
`GRANTS`, as `app:role` pairs: `cron:scheduler objects:objects gateway:hosts`.

**Both keys, always.** A declaration ships with an image CI built, and anything that reaches CI
could write one, so asking alone grants nothing: an app that asks for a role the node does not
grant it is refused before anything is stopped, rather than run sandboxed to fail somewhere later.
A grant alone does nothing either, since an app that asks for no role gets none. So a role is the
operator's decision as every privilege here is, and host knows roles rather than the names of the
services that hold them -- which is what lets infra be built without naming anything above it. See
web's `spec/architecture/layers.md`, "What the package graph cannot see".

Infra's own are the exception, shaped by name as before: host and keeper, the meter, Caddy, the
tunnel and the resolver are what the node is made of, and naming them is infra naming itself.

**An app's directory belongs to the user its image runs as.** host creates it as root, and an image
that runs as someone else -- the meter and the resolver as 65532, the panel as 1000 -- could not
write to it. So before each version starts, host reads the image's `USER` and, when it is a number
other than root, gives the directory itself to that user and group; what is inside is left alone,
since it was written by the app. A user named rather than numbered would need the image's own user
table, which host does not read, and is left as root's.

**Every container has a memory ceiling, and no swap past it.** A declaration states `memory_mb` and
host gives 512 without one; host's and keeper's own containers get theirs the same way, and swap is
set equal to the limit, since a ceiling that can be exceeded into swap only makes the machine
slower. Each figure is the container's measured use with room above it: geo, measured at 290 MiB
held and 130 more pushed into swap against a 512 limit it met sixty times, has 768; host 128,
keeper 64, the meter 32 and Caddy 128, against 50, 9, 19 and 20 measured on 2026-09-28.
**A ceiling is set against the peak, never the idle figure**: keeper idles at 9 MiB and passed 16
fetching host's image, and at a ceiling of 16 it was killed mid-deploy.

### An image is built for speed, and for any node of its architecture

Every Rust program's image compiles its binary with the `container` profile in this repository's `Cargo.toml`, as in the platform's: full
optimization with fat LTO and one codegen unit, no debug information and no symbols. Speed is
chosen over size because a server pays for its binary on every request and for its bytes never;
the build is slower, and it runs on the Mac, where nobody is waiting on a request. No `target-cpu`
is set, so an image is not tied to the chip of the node it was first built for. The profile is its
own rather than `release`, which a local release build would otherwise inherit and pay for.

**A Rust program's image is the binary on `scratch` and nothing else.** Each is linked statically against
musl, so it needs no C library from the image, and the image holds the binary and, for geo, its
data. musl's own allocator is slow under many small allocations, so every program sets mimalloc as
its allocator; without it the static binary would be the slower one. host and keeper make btrfs's
ioctls themselves rather than running `btrfs`, which is what let them leave Debian: there is no
`btrfs` in an empty image, and no command line to inject into once there is no command. The
target follows the platform being built, so the same Dockerfile serves an x86 node.

### The declaration is `service.toml`, beside the Dockerfile

An app states what it needs in `apps/<name>/service.toml` and ships it with its image. host is a
program deployed apart from the file it reads, so the file carries a `version` and host refuses one
it does not know before reading anything else, while a key it does not know is ignored -- see the
workspace's `json.md`. What the keys are is
[manifest/mod.rs](../../libs/deploy/src/manifest/mod.rs); `libs/deploy`'s tests read the copies of the
platform's declarations under `libs/deploy/fixtures/` -- see [../repository.md](../repository.md) --
so a change there is copied in with the reader that accepts it.

An upload is written to disk whole before anything is stopped, so a transfer cut short never leaves
an app down.

## One token, behind two doors

No account system: there is one user. Reaching the panel from the public goes through the tunnel
with Cloudflare Access in front. Behind that, and directly on the LAN and the tailnet, **one long
API token is required everywhere** -- the one exception to the apps behind Caddy authenticating
nothing. host holds the Docker socket, so its token is root on the machine, and a device on the LAN
without it gets nothing.

- It lives in this repository's `secrets.json`, so a mise task deploys without asking. On the
  machine it lives in host's own `.env` and is read back over SSH when forgotten. A browser keeps it
  as a saved password.
- **It never goes to GitHub.** The one secret GitHub holds is the webhook's, and what it signs can
  do nothing but ask host to look at a run it will check for itself. A compromise of CI must not be
  a compromise of the panel, or the reversal above bought nothing.

## host never updates itself; keeper updates host

An updater cannot be the thing it updates: a broken update leaves nothing running that could undo
it. So there are two programs, and each updates the other, never itself.

- **keeper** is small and rarely changes. It deploys host by the same stop, snapshot, start and check
  as any app -- one procedure, in `libs/deploy`, that both programs call -- against host's
  `/health`, which answers only once host reads its own database and reaches Docker. On failure it
  puts the previous host back.
- **host** deploys everything else, keeper included.

**Infra's shape is chosen by name, never by a declaration.** host and keeper run privileged,
with the Docker socket and the whole of `/data`; `meter` runs as an observer, which
[meter.md](meter.md) describes; and every other app runs as the section on what a deployment may
ask for describes. Which shape a container gets is decided by the program deploying it from the
app's name -- host, keeper, the meter, Caddy, the tunnel and the resolver, and only those -- so no
`service.toml` can ask for infra's reach. host deploys keeper and the meter; keeper deploys host. Both start from the one `.env` in host's directory, which is why the token has
one home on the machine.

**keeper keeps no state.** Every container carries the version it runs in a label, so keeper reads
what host runs back from Docker; a host started by hand carries none, and the declaration keeper was
just sent stands in for it beside the image it really runs. Each program removes old images only of
what it deploys -- host of the apps and keeper, keeper of host -- so neither can remove the other's
way back.

**host rolls forward, not back.** keeper guards one failure only: a host that does not start.
Anything wrong with a host that does start is fixed by pushing the next host, because that update is
carried by keeper and never by the program that is broken. That is what lets keeper stay small
enough to read at once, and its stability comes from its size rather than from rules about it. CI
builds only what changed, so keeper's image moves only when keeper's code does.

**keeper has its own intake.** `mise run host deploy host` goes to `keeper.internal.ixc.one`, never to
host, and a notice about a run that built host goes to keeper too. Routed through host, a broken
host would stand between the fix and the machine. keeper's whole interface is on both suffixes,
like any app's: `keeper.internal.ixc.one` on the LAN and the tailnet, and `keeper.canmi.app` behind
Access. `/notice`, the path the Worker reaches it by, is one route of that interface rather than an
exception cut through it, and a request there can only ask it to look at a run.

**A run that built host is keeper's first, and host's only after.** The notice reaches both at once,
and the first run that built both acted on it at once: host replaced keeper while keeper was
fetching the new host, and the host it was about to put in place never arrived. So host leaves such
a run alone, and keeper, once host is replaced -- or put back, if the new one failed -- passes the
run on to host marked as done with host. The rest of the run, keeper included, is then deployed by
the host that run built.

It is reached through Caddy like everything else, which was chosen over binding keeper's port to the
machine's address directly. The cost is that a Caddy that is down makes keeper unreachable too;
accepted, because Caddy starts from the file host last wrote and fails independently of host, so
the case keeper exists for -- a broken host -- leaves Caddy standing.

**Rejected: two identical full instances, A active and B standby.** Two holders of the Docker socket
need a leader election, and the standby logic would live inside the program that changes most. The
variant where B catches up once A succeeds also discards the fallback at the moment a latent bug is
still invisible.

The first host is started by hand, from its `docker-compose.yml`, since nothing earlier exists to
start it. keeper is never started by hand: the first one is deployed by host.

## The control plane going down is not an outage

Containers are kept alive by dockerd's restart policy, and routes live in Caddy, not in host. So a
host or keeper that is down means nothing can be deployed, and nothing stops being served.

**A node's Docker starts only once `/data` is mounted.** Every container binds a path under it, and
Docker started without it creates those paths empty on the root disk: Caddy comes up with no
configuration, host with a new database, and every app on nothing, all of it looking like a clean
start. `/data` keeps `nofail` in fstab, so a node with a failed disk still boots and answers ssh,
and a drop-in gives the Docker unit `RequiresMountsFor=/data`, so it waits for the mount and does
not start without it. Nothing needs starting in order beyond that: every container restarts on its
own policy, and Caddy starts from the file host last wrote whether or not host is up yet.

### Caddy is deployed like any app, and is the one door

**Caddy is `apps/network/caddy`, built here and deployed by host, in a shape its name alone gets: the
edge.** The official build with two modules, xcaddy's Cloudflare DNS provider for its certificates
and the rate limiter host renders each service's limits into; declared, versioned, rolled back and
shown in the panel as every app is. The shape differs from an app's sandbox in four things:

- Its ports, 80, 443 and 443 over UDP, are published on the machine; no other container publishes
  any but the resolver, which publishes DNS's.
- It stands on the `edge` network, which the tunnel shares, rather than on one of its own, and
  after every deploy host joins it to each app's network again, since a new container is on none.
- Beside its `data/` -- certificates, and the admin socket -- it mounts `host/`, the configuration
  host writes, read-only, and `config/`.
- It keeps one capability, binding a low port; its root is read-only as an app's is.

Its health is its admin socket, `data/admin.sock`, asked `/config/` as the meter's is asked
`/health`, and that socket is where host loads every configuration. The Cloudflare token its DNS
provider proves certificates with is its `secret.env`, as any app's secret is. **Without the token
it does not start at all**, so a node's first Caddy deployed by host needs `secret.env` in place
before it, or every door closes; the one it replaces is brought back by hand from the compose file
beside it, `docker compose up -d`.

### The tunnel is deployed like any app, at the address Caddy trusts

**cloudflared is `apps/network/tunnel`, deployed by host in a shape its name alone gets**: sandboxed as an
app is, but standing on `edge` at `tunnel_source` from host's configuration -- the one address
Caddy believes `Cf-Connecting-Ip` from, so a visitor's address is only ever taken from it. Its
routes are the dashboard's, a remotely-managed tunnel; its token is `TUNNEL_TOKEN` in its
`secret.env`; its health is its metrics server's `/ready`, on its port, which host reaches by
standing on `edge` too. A tunnel that is down closes the public side and the notices CI sends, so
the one it replaced is brought back by hand, and the LAN and the tailnet, which never pass it, are
how.

### The inside side answers the internal gateway alone

**Caddy has a third side, `inside`, beside the LAN's and the tunnel's**: plain HTTP on 8080,
published nowhere, so only a container sharing a network with Caddy reaches it -- and every app
shares one, so that is not enough on its own. It refuses any request whose `x-internal` is not
`INTERNAL_TOKEN`, from Caddy's `secret.env`, so of those containers only a holder of the token gets
through: the internal gateway, and a service at home with a limit to count. It answers one name,
`api.inside`, with every scope, taken off as the tunnel's side does, and counts no limit, since what
reaches it was counted by the gateway that sent it. It is the node's counterpart of what a Worker
has by binding and by VPC service; see platform's `spec/architecture/gateway.md`, "Inside the house, the same names
answer locally".

**A scope says which sides carry it**, as `sides` under `[api]`: `private`, `tunnel` and `inside`,
all three when left out. `quota` names `inside` alone, so its door, which takes any key, is on
neither the LAN's API host nor the tunnel's. `inside` is never left out, since it is how the
internal gateway reaches every service at home.

**The LAN's side carries the gateway's hostnames too** -- the `[edge]` its declaration claims, which
host renders because the node grants the gateway `hosts` -- with certificates by DNS challenge as
the private suffix has, and hands them to the internal gateway. It sets `Cf-Connecting-Ip` to
the address it was asked from, over whatever the caller sent, which is the one place the internal
gateway takes a caller's address from.

### The resolver answers the gateway's names, and passes the rest on

**The house's DNS is `apps/network/resolver`, CoreDNS adopted from upstream, in a shape its name alone
gets**: sandboxed as an app is, and publishing 53 over UDP and TCP on the machine, the one container
beside Caddy that publishes anything. host renders its whole configuration, as it does Caddy's, and
nothing about it is written by hand.

**A query passes down one chain, and a step that fails is skipped, never waited on:**

1. **The gateway's names**, answered in the resolver's own process with the node's address, so the
   LAN and the tailnet reach the internal gateway: the names its `[edge]` claims -- the API and CDN
   hosts, the two apexes -- and a deployment's name read from its regions and providers, all
   written there from the sdk's `GATEWAY_NAMES`. Every other name
   in those zones -- `www.`, a record of the author's own -- goes on down the chain and answers as it
   does in public. Nothing outside the process is asked, so this step has nothing to fail on.
2. **A filter**, when one is deployed -- an ad blocker, say -- asked first for every other name. It
   is to be in the chain because it runs, and out of it because it does not, with nothing changed
   by hand. The step is rendered and tested, but no deployment feeds it yet: host passes an empty
   list of filters. A name it blocks comes back blocked: that is an answer, not a failure, and is not asked
   again further down. Its own upstream is the router or a public resolver, never this one, or a
   query would go round in a circle.
3. **The router**, then **the public resolvers**, from host's configuration, since they are the
   node's.

From step 2 on, each is asked in that order, the first that answers wins, and one that is down --
timing out, refusing, failing its health check -- is passed over until it answers again. A cache
sits in front, so the chain is walked once per answer's lifetime.

**The resolver is the house's first DNS, and the router its second.** DHCP hands both out: with the
node down, a device falls back to the router, reaches the gateway's names through Cloudflare as the
public does, and loses only the filter. The router's own upstream is never the node, for the same
circle's sake. Devices away from home on the tailnet ask it too, for the gateway's zones alone, by
the tailnet's split DNS.

### An upstream image is adopted, not rebuilt

**An image from elsewhere becomes an app by a directory like any other**: its `service.toml`, and a
Dockerfile that is the upstream image at a pinned version, with only what the node needs said on
top -- its user by number, where its data and its port are. A new version is that one line changed,
and CI deploys it as it deploys everything. What it keeps secret stays in its `secret.env` on the
node and never reaches the repository. `tunnel` here, and the platform's `gemini`, came in this way; an app with a page
not at its root declares `home` under `[interface]`, and Caddy sends `/` there.

### host renders all of Caddy, and Caddy remembers nothing

Caddy's whole configuration is derived from host's state: every app, every name, every upstream that
is not a container -- the NAS behind `nas.canmi.app` is one. host renders it complete, writes it to
the file Caddy starts from, and then loads the same bytes through Caddy's admin API. Never a partial
patch, never Caddy's own autosave, never `--resume`. A full render is cheap, and one derivation means
the state host shows is the state being served.

**The file is what keeps this section true.** Pushed alone, a Caddy that restarts before host --
after a reboot, say -- would start empty and serve nothing until host came up. The file is written
by host and is the same bytes it pushes, so it is not a second record, and Caddy recovers alone.

The Caddyfile is retired with this. What it held by hand is entries in host.

**A route to a device that speaks only TLS is reached over TLS, unverified.** The UniFi router
answers on HTTPS alone, under a certificate it signed itself, and its route is written
`https://10.10.10.1`. Caddy connects over TLS and does not check that certificate: the only way to
check it would be to pin it, and a device that makes itself a new one on an update would then stop
answering with nothing to say why. The hop is the LAN, between two machines in the same house, so
what verification would guard against is not on the path.

Such a device also believes it is at its own address. UniFi refuses a WebSocket whose `Origin` is not
its own, so every live view of its interface failed behind the proxy while the pages themselves
loaded. Caddy therefore rewrites `Origin` for these routes -- but only an `Origin` that is exactly
the name it is served under, which becomes the device's own. Any other origin reaches the device
unchanged, so the check the device makes against another site opening its socket in the author's
browser still stands; it is translated, never switched off.

**A name may send its root elsewhere.** An application whose interface lives under a path -- gemini's
panel is under `/admin` -- is given a `home`, and a request for exactly `/` is redirected there with a
307 while every other path reaches the application untouched. Caddy sends the root to `home` and no
further; where the application goes from there is its own. It is a redirect and not a rewrite: the
browser then asks for the paths the interface expects, and an API under `/v1/` never meets it. A
`home` has to stay on its own name -- `//` and `/\` are another site to a browser -- or the name
becomes an open redirect.

**Every name is compressed at Caddy, and no app compresses for itself.** Each route host renders
encodes its answer with zstd or gzip, whichever the client prefers; an answer that arrives already
encoded is passed through. Compression is a property of the edge of the node, like TLS, so it is
configured once there rather than in every app and every vendor's image. A `text/event-stream`
answer is left uncompressed, since an encoder holds what it compresses and a stream has to arrive
as it is sent.

**Caddy's admin endpoint is a unix socket, never a port.** Every app shares a network with Caddy,
so an admin port would let any app rewrite every route. The socket sits in a directory only Caddy
and host mount.

**A Caddy container that is recreated, not restarted, comes back attached to no app's network.**
host attaches it to all of them again whenever it starts and whenever it is asked to reapply, so the
remedy is one request rather than a list of commands.

## The panel is an app of its own

**The panel is `apps/deploy/panel`, a SvelteKit server on Node, and host's interface; host itself has
none.** host holds the Docker socket and the whole of `/data`, so what faces a browser is kept out
of it: a panel broken into reaches host's API and the private services it shows -- cron and the
ledger, over the private network -- and nothing below them, and holds no token of its own to reach
any of them with. It passes host the one the visitor signed in with, and asks a private service only
once host has confirmed that token, since those services ask for none themselves. host deploys it like any
app, in the sandbox, under a reserved name, restarted and never stopped from itself.

- **host answers on its own network alone.** It binds its port to its address on `app-host`,
  which the panel and keeper join and Caddy does not; every app network host joins to check an
  app's health leaves that port out of reach. Nothing routes a name to host: `infra.internal.ixc.one` and
  `infra.canmi.app` are the panel's.
- **The panel passes `/api/*` and `/notice` on to host**, carrying the session cookie as the
  token, the request's type and the headers an answer needs back -- its cookies, its caching, a
  redirect or a download's name -- and nothing else. An upload is
  streamed through, never held. The hook's notice reaches host this way, and keeper's intake is
  unchanged.
- **Pages are rendered on the server, and what moves is drawn in the browser.** The first paint
  is the page as host's answers make it -- whether the visitor is signed in, the list of apps, an
  app, its images, its routes -- and the charts and everything after an action are the browser's,
  asking through the same `/api`. A page host cannot answer for renders empty and asks again from
  the browser.
- It answers `/health` itself, without asking host, so it stays up to say that host does not.

It is written in `apps/deploy/panel/`, its components named in lowercase like every file.

**It is styled as the site is, in the site's three layers, and colored as nothing else here is.**
Tailwind in the markup for where a thing sits, StyleX for what it looks like, a `<style>` block
for what carries no class -- web's `spec/architecture/css/layers.md` decides which is which, and the build
and development arrangements there are copied rather than re-derived. Its colors are Nord's, one
theme and dark, with no light twin: the sixteen are declared under their own names in `panel.css`,
what the panel means by each is declared beside them, and a surface in `src/lib/style/` reads the
meaning. They are its own rather than `@canmi/kit`'s tokens, which are the site's. Icons are Lucide's, and
what moves -- a page arriving, the sidebar's marker crossing to the next page -- moves on
`@canmi/kit/motion`'s timing, as the editor's panels do.

**Its charts are d3's arithmetic and Svelte's drawing.** d3's scale, shape and array modules
compute the axes, the paths and the point nearest the pointer; the SVG is written in the component,
so it follows the component's state like any other markup and nothing reaches into the DOM behind
Svelte's back. The rest of d3 -- selections, transitions, its axis generator -- is not taken: each
would draw on its own, and the motion is `@canmi/kit/motion`'s. A chart of bytes ticks in binary
units, and a series breaks where points are missing rather than drawing across the gap. **A fill is
for a chart of one or two lines.** One line keeps its gradient and two share it; three or more are
drawn as lines alone, because every fill layered on the others washes the plot toward gray.

**The machine's names are made readable where they are shown, never where they are kept.** A
thermal zone arrives as its driver calls it -- `bigcore`, `littlecore`, `ddr` -- and the panel's
`labels.ts` says it properly, falling back to the name capitalized. big.LITTLE's size words are
never shown as written: big is Performance, little is Efficiency, and a middle tier is Balanced, so
`bigcore0` is Performance cores 0. A cluster has no name of its own, and takes the same words by
how fast each can run; a machine whose clusters all run at one clock shows that one frequency.

**It is laid out for a desktop.** A sidebar and a page beside it, the page's width following the
window; a phone is not refused and not designed for.

**Its build is SvelteKit's Node adapter's, with every dependency bundled in**, so the image is
Node and that build alone, run as Node's own user. It is built on the Node major the workspace pins,
installing the pnpm the repository names.

**The panel signs in with the token, once.** The first visit asks for it; host answers with a
cookie holding it, `HttpOnly`, `Secure` and `SameSite=Strict`, for thirty days, and every request
after carries that.
The API takes the cookie or an `Authorization` header alike, so scripts and keeper are unchanged.
The token is asked for on every door, the LAN's included; from the public, Access stands in front
as well.

**Notifications and a second node come after the first version**, which deploys the apps of this
repository and the platform's and adopts upstream images.

### What host keeps, and where

host's state is four SQLite files by what they hold, since a file costs nothing and one per
subject keeps each small, separately inspectable and separately backed up: `apps.db`, what runs
now and what is held stopped; `routes.db`, the names that reach something host does not run;
`history.db`, every event; and `images.db`, each image flagged for removal and since when. They sit in host's own data directory. A single `host.db` from before
the state was split into four files is read into them once and renamed aside.

**Every event is kept, and none is pruned.** A deploy, a redeploy, a rollback of either kind, a
start, a stop, a restart and a deploy skipped are each a row: which app, what started it -- a CI run
and its commit, an upload, or the panel -- the image, when it started and ended, how it ended, and
why when it failed, with the logs of the failure. The panel pages through them fifty at a time, the
newest first, as far back as they go.

**Every line an app writes is kept.** Docker does not rotate the logs of a container host runs, and
before a container is replaced its whole log is written to `/data/logs/<app>/`, one file per
version it ran, since removing the container would otherwise remove its log. The panel shows the
running container's recent lines and every archived file. Clearing them out is a later decision,
made when the disk says so.

### An app's environment is two files, and the panel shows one

Configuration and secrets are both environment variables, given to the container when it starts,
and both edited in the panel. They are two files in the app's own directory, outside what its
container mounts, readable by root alone:

- `config.env` is configuration: the panel shows every key and value.
- `secret.env` is secrets: the panel shows that a key exists, and never its value. Reading one is
  done over SSH.

They sit in the app's subvolume, so the snapshot a deploy takes holds them, and a failed deploy put
back puts the environment back with the code. A change applies when the container is next started
from its version: the panel says so, and a redeploy does it.

### What the panel can do to an app

- **Redeploy** runs the current version again, as a deploy: snapshot, start, check, and the version
  before put back if the check fails.
- **Roll back** runs the previous version instead, keeping the data and the environment as they are
  now. It is the ordinary way back from a bad version.
- **Roll back with data** does the same and also restores the snapshot taken before the current
  version was deployed, so the data and the environment are as they were then. Everything written
  since is lost, so it is shown as the dangerous one. It is offered while that snapshot is among the
  ones kept.
- **Start, stop and restart** act on the container as it is.

Every one of them is confirmed twice.

**host is listed beside the apps it runs**, read back from its own container's label, since keeper
keeps no record and host none of itself: its logs and its version are there, with no previous
version and no environment, which is its `.env` beside the compose file and read by nothing here.

**The node's own five -- host, keeper, Caddy, the tunnel and the panel -- are restarted from
the panel and never stopped or started.** Each stopped takes the panel, the way in or the way back
with it: host answers the panel, the panel is the interface, Caddy carries it, the tunnel is the
public side and CI's notices, and keeper is what replaces host. host does not redeploy or roll
itself back either, since keeper is the one that replaces it; the other four are redeployed and
rolled back like any app. A restart of host, Caddy or the panel -- what answers the request and
what carries it -- is answered first and done half a second later, and the panel waits for the app
to answer again. host's own is recorded as done when asked, because nothing of it is left to finish
the record once it restarts.

**A stop holds until a start.** A stopped app stays stopped through a reboot -- Docker's own
restart policy does that -- and through a deploy: while it is held, a CI run that built it is recorded
as skipped rather than started. A start runs the version it was stopped at; a redeploy, a rollback
or an upload is a choice to run something, and ends the hold.

### An image is kept while something could run it

**What an image is kept for is decided in host's background, and the panel only reads it.** Once
a minute, or at once when the panel asks, host scans the images and says why each stays: what an
app runs, what it would go back to on a rollback, what any container is made from -- whoever started
it -- and host's own, which keeper keeps and collects. The scan is held in memory, so the Images page
answers at once; Docker's measure of its images on disk, the slow part, is taken outside the deploy
lock.

**An image nothing needs is flagged, and removed an hour after.** The moment it was first found
collectable is kept in `images.db`, so a restart does not start the hour again; one that is needed
again before its hour is up -- the target of a rollback, a container started from it -- is
unflagged. A dangling image a newer build left, an image of an app no longer deployed, an upstream
image a compose file once pulled: each goes on its own.

**What the panel asks of the images is a task in a queue, never a request that waits.** Removing
one now, or collecting all of them now, is answered with the queued task; host's background does
them in order and then scans again, and the page reads the queue and the scan every two seconds
while anything is queued and every fifteen otherwise. Every task and every sweep takes the deploy
lock, so an image a deploy has loaded and not yet started is never taken for one nothing needs.

A deploy still collects on its own what it made unneeded, as it always has.

## Trying host on this machine

**A node is a privileged `docker:dind` container with a btrfs file mounted at `/data`.** host needs
btrfs for every app's directory and Docker Desktop has none it will share: a path inside its VM is
refused as a bind source, and one under `/var` is taken for the Mac's `/private/var`. Inside a dind
container the paths are Linux's own, so host binds what it would bind on the machine:

1. Format a file as btrfs in a throwaway container, into a named volume: `truncate -s 4G`, then
   `mkfs.btrfs`.
2. Start `docker:dind` privileged with that volume and host's port published, and inside it
   `mount -o loop` the file at `/data`.
3. `docker exec -i ... docker load` host's and the apps' archives from `mise run image`, and start
   host inside it as the compose file does, with a token of its own; Caddy's absence is logged and
   ignored.
4. Deploy through its API as `mise run host deploy` would, and point the panel at it:
   `HOST_API=http://localhost:11011 pnpm run dev` in `apps/deploy/panel`. Without `HOST_API` a
   development panel asks the running panel on the machine, signed in as the token mise decrypts.

A copy of the machine's four databases, read over SSH, gives the panel the real apps and history to
draw; `docker cp` cannot see into the btrfs mount, so they go in through `docker exec -i`.
